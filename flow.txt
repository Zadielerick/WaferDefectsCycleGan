1) Train CycleGAN for defects in [Center, etc.] -- train.py
2) Test CycleGAN models at checkpoints (25,50,...,200) and generate outputs -- test.py
3) Calculate FID and KID from output of checkpoints to check performance of each model -- fid-kid-calc.py
	- Gather output of FID and KID as CSV
	- FID/KID scores per defect per epoch
